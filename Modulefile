summary "Installs and Removes Windows Features"
description "This puppet module creates a new defined type 'winfeature'. This can be called within any
class to install/remove windows features based on their ID string ex: 'Web-Server' or a 
comma seperated list of feature IDs ex: 'Telnet-Client,Telnet-Server' 

The functionality is simply a wrapper to the powershell cmdlets 'Add-WindowsFeature' and 'Remove-WindowsFeature'.
All cmdlet parameters are supported by this module. For details about how the above cmdlets operates, please see the 
following microsoft KB Article: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732263.aspx#BKMK_powershell
